# User Stories
> Will need user story for nonusers ( persona for those that aren’t signed up for the application.)

> What data can they access

## Student (Henri)

* I want to open the app and see the landing page
* From landing page, i want to click login (registered)
    * I want to fill in my information (email + password) and click	login (This will automatically detect that my account is an student account and serve me the student menu view.)
    * I want to see the student menu view so i can browse credits, see credits that i’ve done, go to the playlist view to see other peoples work and my profile view.
* From landing page, i want to click create account (unregistered)
    * Our create account wireframe is flawed since different types of users need different fields, so this is an user story path that needs to be created before making the account creation view.
    * Ultimately as a student, i want to create an account and get verified as a student very fast. Can we find a way for the catalyst/teacher to register first and add the email addresses or generate a link from which you can register as a verified student?

This is like a main view from which more accurate user stories in this fashion could be created for each of the views and the views that can be opened from them. From this base story you can add even ten more points to get to a place in the app where the only way you can go is backwards

## Catalyst/Credit Expert (Leo)
* Open application to landing page
* See onboarding video/multimedia with overview
*  Click link to login/signup
* (nonuser) signup form to enter all necessary credentials to become catalyst/educator
* (user) login form with email/username/phonenumber and password
* (user) redirect to personal profile page
* (user) want edit access to certain profile information (i.e. disable edit access for name, a credit expert should not be changing their government name?? But they should be able to change the email they use to interact with application)
* (user) my profile page will also have scroll tiled linked to all credits i have successfully helped students achieve

* Basic method to access catalyst/credit expert user. Will need to define specific criteria for the sign up sheet and what data will be served to the front end for the profile page as well as functionality of the profile page. 
* Maybe a button that links to current Catalyst/Educator leaderboards to see current rankings of all Catalyst/Educators on the platform. 
* Maybe a button that linked to current Credit Experts leaderboard rankings as well

* I will be able access a credit page and:
    * Edit a credit
