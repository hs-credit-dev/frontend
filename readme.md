# HS Credit - App Development
## Big Questions

* What to use? [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) / [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) / [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
    - We have some experience in React and React Native, but if we look at the [link](https://hackr.io/blog/react-native-vs-flutter) Nadav sent, it looks like flutter is the development platform of the future, even though it isn't yet the easiest to work with.
    - There were also points that React could be convertable to flutter in the future.
    - Starting fresh with a new language like Dart is a huge task.
    - Do we need the extra performance from Flutter in this project? What if we use React and try to minimize asset sizes and use light components?
* In terms of backend, we will use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
With experience from Mocha, Sophia and Leo, this is propably the best choice.
* [Wireframes in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5jYXuLg6KU8PjFE07ZJFwM/HSC-APP?node-id=0%3A1)
* Do we want to use Scrum for the project management? Weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 18:00 Helsinki time, maybe another 15 minute meeting on Thursdays, same time?
