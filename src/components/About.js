            <p>Instead of teaching our students how to function like machines, rapidly accessing textbook concepts from memory to fill in a bubble sheet, hs.credit engages students in real world issues relevant to their local community. Each decentralized credit engages students in academic habits like research, revision, questioning, and fact checking which are important for a vibrant democracy and an anti-fragile economy.</p>
