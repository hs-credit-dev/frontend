            <p>At hs.credit, we are the gold standard of academic testing. Each month 11th and 12th grade students can mint one credit-bearing NFT, approved by a committee of 3 credit experts. Socio-economically diverse blocks of these NFTs generate academic capital, a cryptocurrency award for participating students. Educators earn up to $180/hr as credit experts on the platform. The result is quality academic data and a steady stream of high quality, hyper-local youth media.</p>
